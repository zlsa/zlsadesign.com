-- Xon Wasp instructional guide, pg. 315, section "Jump Drive"

Fifteen years after the emissary and her crew had disappeared, the last
remaining assets of Xon Aerospace had finally been auctioned off. For a short
time after the disappearance, they had struggled to remain in operation; but
it soon became clear to Xon's leadership that their ships were no longer being
chosen by the elite classes that had, until then, been keeping them afloat.
And despite the desperate attempts at moving downmarket, to reducing the
manufacturing costs of their ships, to closing down all of their shipyards,
Xon found itself insolvent just four years after the accident.

_The accident._ An emissary for the Alliance had departed for a routine trip
towards Gliese 382c, with sixteen crew and staff aboard the _Liberator_. While
Gliese 382 was well beyond the transverse jump range of most ships, the Xon
Wasp was able to do it without an issue. Its jump drive was tuned more
precisely than the competition; its magnetic resonance capacitors more
powerful. When jumping transverse, it was able to jump 35 light-years; while
competing ships struggled to hit 25. For the trip to Gliese 382c, it was the
clear champion. Or at least, it should have been.

-- Sanctuary Port's greeting message as it appeared on 3255-3-16, Earth
   standard time.

The emissary had never shown up on the sensors at Sanctuary Port. As one of
the most advanced cities on the edge of the human-inhabited "bubble",
Sanctuary Port had one of the most advanced sensor networks in the galaxy,
able to detect the signature ripple of an incoming ship at the staggering
distance of 3.5 AU. They had been informed of the emissary's arrival two hours
before the jump with a superluminal message, picked up by the sensor network
surrounding the planet. A few hours later, before the emissary's scheduled
arrival, Sanctuary Port defense fighters were launched in preparation for the
emissary's arrival. The message had called for a direct atmospheric entry and
landing after dropping out from the Jump, and the defense fighters were
waiting for the signal from Sanctuary Port that the ship had been detected.

Four hours after the scheduled arrival, the defense fighters were recalled and
Sanctuary Port sent word back that the emissary's ship hadn't landed or even
been detected by the sensor network. There had been incidents like this
before, but in every case, the failure lit up the sensors for days. This was
the first time in history that a jumpship had gone missing without even a
ripple on the sensor networks.

> The "Hyperspatial Interstellar Translation Engine", or the "jump drive" as
> it has come to be known, was discovered in 3083 by a team of researchers
> working for Arcturus Interstellar. Its basic method of operation is to
> translate the ship in the W-coordinate, shortening the relative distance in
> XYZ space and allowing the primary engines on the ship to perform the trip
> faster and with far less fuel than an equivalent subluminal ship.
>
> While the mathematics behind the jump drive are well-known, all attempts to
> accurately validate the mathematics involved have been inconclusive. This is
> due to the unpredictable instability incurred by the engine during the
> inter-dimensional translation. Many key factors of the instability have been
> identified, such as the presence of high-mass and high-velocity objects;
> however, many of the lesser factors remain undiscovered to this day.
>
> Since the jump drive operates on a limited supply of energy, excess
> instability can overwhelm the jump drive's energy pool and power-limit the
> ship or, in the most extreme cases of instability, cause it to forcefully
> terminate the jump mid-way. A mis-jump typically results in the jump drive
> coils fused and unable to operate, leaving the ship at very high subluminal
> velocities. The resulting radiation poisoning typically proves lethal to the
> crew before a rescue attempt can be made.
>
> Early experiments at charting the instability encountered during a jump
> resulted in several well-publicized failures of the jump drive. Soon
> afterwards, the Interstellar Astronautical Association drafted and approved
> a recommendation to ship designers to enforce speed ceilings in relative
> space while the jump drive is engaged. This regulation remains in effect
> today, and has limited or wholly prevented thousands of deadly accidents.

"Martinez! You got that corner secured?" comes Matta's voice from behind the
blocky cargo pallet. We were securing the last pallet into this ship, and good
riddance, too. We were loading an atmo-capable ship, which meant the cargo
pallets all had to be manually guided into the enclosed cargo deck instead of
being bolted straight to the exoskeleton of a _proper_ spaceship. It also meant
it was hot as _fuck_ inside.

"Affirm!" I shout back, pulling the clamp into place and feeling for the inset
steel locking pin with the palm of my hand. The locking pin extends from the
clamp's backside and holds the clamp shut during flight. On the cargo decks of
vacuum ships, we'd only need to lock two or three clamps; but on atmo-capable
ships, which would often fly sideways during entry, we were required to lock
all eight clamps on the pallet.

"Martinez? Your side all locked?" shouts Hager from the direction of the cargo
door.

"Clamped and locked," I call, pulling myself upright and mopping my brow. "This
the last one, ey?

"Job's done!" he shouts back. "Let's debark and give the signal."

Matta and I make our way through the grid of pallets to the cargo door.
It's a beacon of light compared to the gritty darkness of the cargo bay.
Like most atmo ships, Xon couldn't afford the mass penalty of lights, so we had to wear headlamps to secure the pallets.
We gratefully switched these off as we stepped onto the elevated cargo platform within the climate-controlled hangar.
Far above us was the tangled mess of air ducts and power cables that kept the station running.

"Matta -- Martinez!"
Hager claps us on the back as we clip ourselves to the cargo platform railing.
"Fastest I've ever seen those atmo ships loaded up.
Like to say faster than most crews could do a vacship!"
Martinez punches the "Down" button on the cargo platform, and it begins to pull back from the ship, accompanied by the _pop--pop--pop_ sound of the magnetic stabilizer clamps releasing the ship.

Diego Martinez

Despite scoring quite well on the aptitude tests, I was drafted to the cargo
handling division. I'd heard whispers about the Director of Operations and his
personal vendetta against my parents; apparently, he'd decided he disliked me
as well.

The emissary handpicked me. I don't know why; after all, I was merely a grunt,
a stationside cargo handler. I'd lived aboard the _Arcturus IIe_ my whole
life. I'd never even been down to the surface; all I'd ever known was the
low-G habitat of the _Arcturus_. I hadn't ever seen my parents, and I never
would. The fines and punishments they were given were inherited by me; I'd be
long dead by the time their debts to Arcturus Interstellar were paid off.

I handpicked my crew, of course. Only the best of the best would be coming
with me. We were going to a dangerous place; the distant worlds weren't a
pleasant place to be. There wouldn't be any rescue crews nor defense fighters.
We'd need to bring along

Your Wasp's jump drive has been factory-tuned for general flight.
