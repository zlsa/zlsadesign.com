-- Xon Wasp instructional guide, pg. 315, section "Jump Drive"

Fifteen years after the emissary and her crew had disappeared, the last remaining assets of Xon Aerospace had finally been auctioned off.
For a short time after the disappearance, they had struggled to remain in operation; but it soon became clear to Xon's leadership that their ships were no longer being chosen by the elite classes that had, until then, been keeping them afloat.
And despite the desperate attempts at moving downmarket, to reducing the manufacturing costs of their ships, to closing down all of their shipyards; Xon found itself insolvent just four years after the accident.

_The accident._
An emissary for the Interstellar Union, Karina Nilsson, had departed for a routine trip towards the rim system Gliese 382c, with sixteen crew and staff aboard the _Liberator_.
While the Gliese 382 star system was well beyond the transverse jump range of most ships, the Xon Wasp was able to do it without an issue.
Its jump drive was tuned more precisely than the competition; its magnetic resonance capacitors more aligned.
When jumping transverse (towards or away from the center of the Milky Way), it was able to jump 35 light-years; competing ships struggled to reach 20 light-years.
For the trip to Gliese 382c, it was the clear champion.
Or at least, it should have been.

-- Sanctuary Port's greeting message as it appeared on 3255-3-16, Earth standard time.

The _Liberator_ had never shown up on the sensors at Sanctuary Port.
As one of the most advanced cities on the rim of the human-inhabited "bubble", Sanctuary Port had one of the most precise sensor networks in the galaxy.
The array of sensors spread out all through the system were able to detect the signature ripple of an incoming ship several hours ahead of the transition to normal space.

They had been informed of the emissary's arrival two hours before the jump with a superluminal message from the Interstellar Union, picked up by the sensor network surrounding the planet.
Soon after, Sanctuary Port defense fighters were launched in preparation for the emissary's arrival.
The message had called for a direct atmospheric entry and landing after dropping out from the Jump, and the defense fighters were waiting for the signal from Sanctuary Port that the ship had been detected.

Four hours after the scheduled arrival, the defense fighters were recalled and Sanctuary Port sent word back to the Union that the emissary's ship hadn't landed or even been detected by the sensor network.
There had been incidents like this before, but in every case, the jump drive failure and the ensuing cloud of radioactive debris lit up the sensors for days.
This was the first time in history that a jumpship had gone missing without even a ripple on the sensor networks.

> The "Hyperspatial Interstellar Translation Engine", or the "jump drive" as it has come to be known, was discovered in 3083 by a team of researchers working for Arcturus Interstellar Corporation.
> Its basic method of operation is to translate the ship in the W-coordinate, shortening the relative distance in XYZ space and allowing the primary engines on the ship to perform the trip faster and with far less fuel than an equivalent subluminal ship.
>
> While the mathematics behind the jump drive are well-known, all attempts to accurately validate the mathematics involved have been inconclusive.
> This is due to the unpredictable instability incurred by the engine during the inter-dimensional translation.
> Many key factors of the instability have been identified, such as the presence of high-mass and high-velocity objects; however, many of the lesser factors remain undiscovered to this day.
>
> Since the jump drive operates on a limited supply of energy, excess instability can overwhelm the jump drive's energy pool and power-limit the ship or, in the most extreme cases of instability, cause it to forcefully terminate the jump mid-way.
> A mis-jump typically results in the jump drive coils fused and unable to operate, leaving the ship at very high subluminal velocities.
> The resulting radiation poisoning typically proves lethal to the crew before a rescue attempt can be made.
>
> Early experiments at charting the instability encountered during a jump resulted in several well-publicized failures of the jump drive.
> Soon afterwards, the Interstellar Astronautical Association drafted and approved a recommendation to ship designers to enforce speed ceilings in relative space while the jump drive is engaged.
> This regulation remains in effect today, and has limited or wholly prevented thousands of deadly accidents.

"Martinez! You got that corner secured?" comes Matta's voice from behind the blocky cargo pallet.
We were securing the last pallet into this ship, and good riddance, too.
We were loading an atmo-capable ship, which meant the cargo pallets all had to be manually guided into the enclosed cargo deck instead of being bolted straight to the exoskeleton of a _proper_ spaceship.
It also meant it was hot as _fuck_ inside.

"Affirm!" I shout back, pulling the clamp into place and feeling for the inset steel locking pin with the palm of my hand.
The locking pin extends from the clamp's backside and holds the clamp shut during flight.
Like most atmo ships, Xon couldn't afford the mass penalty of lights, so we had to wear headlamps to secure the pallets.
On the cargo decks of vacuum ships, we'd only need to lock two or three clamps; but on atmo-capable ships, which would often fly sideways during entry, we were required to lock all eight clamps on the pallet.
"Martinez? Your side all locked?" shouts Hager from the direction of the cargo door.

"Clamped and locked," I call, pulling myself upright and mopping my brow.
"This the last one, ey?"

"Job's done!" he shouts back.
"Let's debark and give the signal."

The air in the cargo deck had the sharp metallic tang of stainless steel exposed to hard vacuum, and I was happy to get out of this ship.
Matta and I make our way through the maze of pallets to the cargo door; a beacon of light compared to the gritty darkness of the cargo bay.
We gratefully switched these off as we stepped onto the elevated cargo platform within the climate-controlled hangar.
Far above us was the tangled mess of air ducts and power cables that kept the station running.

"Matta -- Martinez!"
Hager claps us on the back as we clip ourselves to the cargo platform railing.
"Fastest I've ever seen those atmo ships loaded up.
Like to say faster than most crews could do a vacship!"
Martinez punches the "Down" button on the cargo platform, and it begins to pull back from the ship, accompanied by the _pop--pop--pop_ sound of the magnetic stabilizer clamps releasing the ship.

As the cargo platform returns to the station, I glance up at the crew access arm that's even now sliding out from the station to meet the ship's airlock.
Crew's in a hurry to get off the station, seems like.

The _Liberator_ was docked at the _Angel's Rest_ orbital station in the (???) system.
While this system was not among the lawless wilderness of the independent systems beyond the Bubble, there was a feeling here of tension, of unpredictability, that the core systems didn't have.
The Interstellar Union provided the supplies, expertise, and military to keep these systems at the edge of the human-inhabited Bubble running smoothly and with minimum fuss.
It was an arrangement that benefited both the Union, which could more easily control access to the core systems; and the rim systems, which no longer needed to maintain their own defense fleets.

The interior the _Angel's Rest_ station wasn't _bad_, but it wasn't that impressive, either.
The hallways were cramped and the air had the metallic taste of cheap CO2 scrubbers.
The docking bay only had enough ports for six ships the size of the _Liberator_, and only one for the large cargo freighters that kept the station running.
I didn't want to stay for a minute longer than I had to; I needed to keep up my reputation until the very end.
The Interstellar Union was watching and waiting, and so was Sanctuary Port.

My pilot and I were sitting at of the simulated outdoor areas, waiting for the cargo handlers to finish loading the _Liberator_.
There were plants here, engineered to survive the low gravity and synthetic light.
The greenery around the table wasn't as impressive as some planetside ports I'd been to as an emissary for the Interstellar Union, but it was perfectly serviceable for a quick chat with my pilot.

"Do you know who's got the data?" he asks me.

My pilot's sitting across the table from me, arms crossed.
We're sipping the flavored protein creams that are synonymous with living in low-G environments.
It's a nasty concoction with the consistency of glue, but when combined with regular exercise, it's the simplest and cheapest way to keep muscle and bone mass up in low-G.

"No, not at the moment," I reply, glancing up momentarily at the glint of the security camera in the corner, nestled between the conduits and piping.
"I have my suspicions, but now's not the time or place."

My motives were my own and my evidence was fabricated, of course.
But he still believed in it, and he only had to do so for a few more days.
He dips his head in a quick nod. "Thought so, but it's good to know all, avoid being caught flat-footed.
The Interstellar Union doesn't like those smugglers.
It'd be insane to try and sneak schematics out under their noses --- especially given that they're working for you, the Emissary."

I agree silently. It _would_ be insane, if it were true.
The rim planets had a long and storied reputation of smuggling schematics, ship designs, and even manufacturing plans out of the Interstellar Union.
The Interstellar Union had an equally long history of severely punishing both the thief and those who helped them, knowingly or not.
It was easy for me to take advantage of this precedent for my own ends.

My pilot glances at his eyeset for a moment, his eyes unfocused while he checks up on the status of the _Liberator_.
"So we're leaving immediately after cargo load, then?"

"Yes," I say.
"The sooner we get off-station, the better.
I've sent an encrypted message to the Interstellar Union, and they're already going to be sending investigators here.
The investigators will start questioning the crew immediately after they touch station.
We don't want to give the thief any opportunity to sabotage the _Liberator._"

My eyeset taps me, and I glance at the notification panel in the corner of my eye.
"Looks like it's loaded up and we're good to go," I tell my pilot.
He nods and pulls his empty cup off the table and swings it towards one of the recleaning bins, the faceted exterior catching the light as it tumbled.
It slowly traces a graceful arc over the railing and glides straight into the slot.

He's a good pilot, one of the best I've met.
I really do wish I had a chance to save him from the cold death of the airlock, but I can't take the chance of him stopping me.
I can fly the ship myself, and I will do whatever it takes to see my plan succeed.

When we get to the hangar, the _Liberator_ is already prepared for launch.
All of the supplies I'd ordered have been brought into the cargo hold and locked down.
Inside, there were enough supplies to keep me alive for several months.
The propellant tanks within the _Liberator_ were loaded up to the brim with enough propellant for 150 light-years of travel, more than enough for me to get there and back.

We step through the airlock doors to the crew access arm, my pilot leading the way.
The arm is a long, spindly affair, with cross-bracing and a complex wire suspension rig to reduce mass.
The wire mesh grating on the floor clatters as we walk across it towards the passenger airlock of the _Liberator_.
I run my hand over the railing on the side, glancing down towards the hangar deck, dozens of meters below.
It's the last time I'll be surrounded by this kind of civilization for the next few months.
I want to commit it to memory before I leave, in case I never see it again.

My pilot taps his gloved hand against the hull of the ship, urging me on.
I reluctantly step forward, crossing the remaining few meters to the _Liberator_'s.
I step over the threshold into the airlock to join my pilot, standing at the airlock control panel.
"Clear," I tell him, and he punches the button to close the door and cycle the airlock.
Even though the _Liberator_ is in a pressurized atmosphere in the station hangar, we still keep the interior atmosphere separate.
That means a full airlock cycle every time we enter or exit.

The crew access arm slowly slides back, accompanied by the hum of a winch and the creak of a metal-on-metal joint, long overdue for lubrication.
The thick door of the airlock slowly slides down into place, a series of metallic clicks echoing in the airlock as the locking hooks secure the door.
"Continue," I say to my pilot as part of the airlock sequence, and he pulls the lever to begin the air cycle.
Air tanks onboard the _Liberator_ open their valves, and the vents scattered around the ceiling begin to flood the airlock with fresh air, forcing the station-side atmosphere out of the floor vents.

The green lights surrounding the interior door flicker for a fraction of a second, then stay illuminated.
"Air equalized," states my pilot.
"Continue," I reply.

He pulls the lever on the interior door, and it swings open without a sound.
I step forward onto the white polymer floor of the airlock "lobby", as it's called.
He steps ahead of me and pulls himself up the ladder leading to the passenger decks.
After he steps out of view, I look back to confirm that the airlock is closed and locked, then follow him towards the bridge.

<!--
Rather than put two doors on the spacecraft, the engineers at Xon came up with a smart solution.
The airlock and the cargo bay share the same door to the outside, about four meters tall and three wide.
The floor of the cargo bay rotates around the vertical axis, and the airlock is built into this rotating section.
It connects back to the passenger decks at the center of the ship with the vertical passenger tunnel in the center of the ship.
To unload cargo, the cargo bay is rotated to bring the cargo directly to the door, so the crane only needs to pick it up and lower it to the ground.
And to let passengers on or off, the cargo bay rotates to bring the airlock to the door, and the airlock slides out to meet the crew access arm.

The _Liberator_ is configured for a combination of passengers and cargo, so the airlock had to share space with the cargo bay.
The engineers at Xon figured out a very nifty solution
-->

<!--
I step onto the white polymer floor of the passenger deck.
The _Liberator_'s passenger decks are lined with the stuff; it's a bit squishy, to help reduce zero-G injuries, but it's also thin and light enough to be installed in a spacecraft.
My pilot stepped through to the vertical crew tunnel, which ran the length of the passenger decks, from the bridge all the way to the airlock.
The _Liberator_ is configured for a combination of passengers and cargo; below the four passenger decks and the bridge, there's a substantial cargo bay below.
WIth the extra cargo bays, this configuration of the Xon Wasp was the most advanced medium-class jumpship in the entire Interstellar Union fleet.

Thankfully, it didn't take much time to convince him that one of the crew was smuggling precious Interstellar Union schematics to the rim planets.
The rim planets had a long and storied reputation of data theft, and the Interstellar Union punished the both the thief and all those who helped them, knowingly or not.
It was a risk nobody was willing to take, including my pilot.
So we had agreed to launch early and leave the rest of the crew behind.
When they got word of what I'd done, the Interstellar Union would investigate

<!--second only to visiting the rim while flying a ship made in the Bubble.-->

<!--

So here's the current plot from this point:

Karina Nilsson was an independent pilot flying under contract for Arcturus Interstellar Corporation, back during the expansion.
Her partner was on a resupply run to the rim (outer edge of the bubble) when his ship was shot down by a Arcturus Interstellar defense squadron while landing on the planet.
Turns out there was a civil war going on over the independence of a planet, and his ship had been misidentified by the Arcturus ground defenses as a ship owned by the 'rebels'.
Arcturus wasn't sure if he was dead or not, so they told everyone that the ship had been lost mid-jump.
In reality, his crashed ship was taken by the rebels, but only after he had escaped on foot.
He hasn't been seen since; however, the planet is very amenable to long-term outdoor living, so he could very possibly be alive.

Arcturus eventually ceded the planet to the rebels, after they realized they couldn't keep control of a system so far out from the core.

The truth took a while to filter its way to the emissary.
When she realized that his death had been covered up by Arcturus, she began to plan a rescue mission.
Her long career as a skilled pilot helped her get a job as an ambassador to the Interstellar Union, and she began to perform regular flights to the planets of the rim.
Over many years, she amassed the reputation needed to get a ship with the range necessary to reach the planet her partner was last seen on.

When she was finally able to fly in the ship she needed, she staged a coup with her pilot.
Her pilot was under the impression they were abandoning the other crew because of a supposed mole on the ship, carrying critical information for the rebels.
However, her plan is to let him fly with her until they're a long distance from the bubble, then abandon him as soon as possible.

Diego Martinez

Despite scoring quite well on the aptitude tests, I was drafted to the cargo
handling division. I'd heard whispers about the Director of Operations and his
personal vendetta against my parents; apparently, he'd decided he disliked me
as well.

The emissary handpicked me. I don't know why; after all, I was merely a grunt,
a stationside cargo handler. I'd lived aboard the _Arcturus IIe_ my whole
life. I'd never even been down to the surface; all I'd ever known was the
low-G habitat of the _Arcturus_. I hadn't ever seen my parents, and I never
would. The fines and punishments they were given were inherited by me; I'd be
long dead by the time their debts to Arcturus Interstellar were paid off.

I handpicked my crew, of course. Only the best of the best would be coming
with me. We were going to a dangerous place; the distant worlds weren't a
pleasant place to be. There wouldn't be any rescue crews nor defense fighters.
We'd need to bring along
