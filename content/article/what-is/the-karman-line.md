You may have heard people refer to the "edge of space" – 100km – as the Kármán
line. But what does that mean, and what's so significant about it?

# What is space?

Let's fall back to a question that's easier to answer. Or is it? "Space"
typically means "outside of an atmosphere"; for example, we consider the ISS
(which orbits the Earth at about 400km) to be "in space". It's obviously not
in the Earth's atmosphere anymore; anything in the atmosphere is subject to
drag, and with the ISS travelling at 17,500mph, the drag would be very
apparent, to say the least.

Now, let's talk about the Earth's atmosphere. At sea level, it's rather dense;
in fact, it's dense enough to generate lift by moving an airfoil through the
air. (This is how airplanes and helicopters work.) As you move up, though, the
air gets thinner. This is because the limited amount of atmosphere is pulled
down to the surface via Earth's gravity.

The curve actually isn't linear, either. The atmosphere quickly thins off; at
20km (about 12 miles), the atmospheric pressure is less than half of sea level
pressure; and at 50km (about 31 miles), the pressure is about 10% of sea
level pressure.

This means that, theoretically, Earth's atmosphere will never end. It just
gets less and less dense as you ascend, making it impossible to even _have_ a
line where one side is definitively "space" and the other side definitively
"atmosphere". This is why the Kármán line exists.

But first, let's take a look at atmospheric flight.

# Atmospheric flight

Given the fact that the atmosphere gradually thins out as altitude increases,
aircraft need to increase their speed at higher altitudes to keep the total
lift constant. This is an important concept: if it was going fast enough, a
747 would be able to fly at 50km, several times higher than normal.
Unfortunately, these speeds are well in excess of Mach 1, and thus impossible,
for the 747.

{{< note title="Weird stuff" >}}
The reduction in lift at high altitudes usually isn't the direct limiting
factor in the altitude ceiling of aircraft. The real limitation is how much
power the engine can produce. Since engines directly consume atmospheric
oxygen, the thin air at higher altitudes reduces engine power, thus indirectly
limiting top speed and therefore maximum lift.

# Space flight

Anything in orbit around the Earth is essentially falling around the earth.
The ISS orbits at about the lowest feasible altitude for a large, very
high-drag object: 400km, and it still needs to be reboosted every few months.
