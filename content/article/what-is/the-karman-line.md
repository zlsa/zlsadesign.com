You may have heard people refer to the "edge of space" – 100km – as the Kármán
line. But what does that mean, and what's so significant about it?

<!-- more -->

Simply put, the Kármán line is loosely defined as the altitude at which a
fixed-wing aircraft would need to travel faster than orbital velocities to
produce enough lift. This is a bit of a complex concept to understand, so
I'll break it down.

# What is space?

Let's fall back to a question that's easier to answer. Or is it? "Space"
typically means "outside of the atmosphere"; for example, we consider the ISS,
at {{<km "400" >}}, to be "in space". It's obviously not in the Earth's
atmosphere anymore; anything in the atmosphere is subject to drag, and with
the ISS traveling at {{< km-s "7.8" 1 >}}, the drag would be very apparent, to
say the least.

Now, let's talk about the Earth's atmosphere. At sea level, it's rather dense;
in fact, it's dense enough to generate lift by moving an airfoil through the
air. (This is how airplanes and helicopters work.) As you move up, though, the
air gets thinner. This is because the limited amount of atmosphere is pulled
down to the surface via Earth's gravity.

The curve actually isn't linear, either. The atmosphere quickly thins off; at
{{< km 20 >}}, the atmospheric pressure is less than half of sea level
pressure; and at {{< km 50 >}}, the pressure is about 10% of sea
level pressure.

This means that, theoretically, Earth's atmosphere will never end. It just
gets less and less dense as you ascend, making it impossible to even _have_ a
line where one side is definitively "space" and the other side definitively
"atmosphere". This is why the Kármán line exists.

But first, let's take a look at atmospheric flight.

# Atmospheric flight

Given the fact that the atmosphere gradually thins out as altitude increases,
aircraft need to increase their speed at higher altitudes to keep the total
lift constant. This is an important concept: if it was going fast enough, a
747 would be able to fly at {{< km 50 >}}, several times higher than normal.
Unfortunately, the speeds required to fly straight and level at that altitude
are well in excess of Mach 1, and thus impossible, for the 747.

{{< note title="" >}}It turns out that at high altitudes, the loss
of lift due to the thinner air does not directly define the maximum altitude of
an aircraft. The real limitation is how much power the engine can produce.
Since engines directly consume atmospheric oxygen to mix with their fuel, the
thin air at higher altitudes reduces engine power, thus indirectly limiting
top speed and therefore the maximum amount of lift that can be generated.{{</
note >}}

This establishes a relationship between atmospheric density and the minimum
velocity needed to maintain level flight.

# Space flight

Anything in orbit around the Earth is essentially falling around the earth.
The ISS orbits at about the lowest feasible altitude for a large, very
high-drag object: {{< km 400 >}}, and it still needs to be reboosted every few
months. So there isn't _no_ drag at the ISS; there's just very little. Now,
the ISS is traveling at about {{< km-s "7.8" 1 >}}; for a 747 to produce
enough lift for level flight at that altitudes, it would need to fly far
faster than the orbital velocity of the ISS.

That's exactly what the Kármán line is: the
