In the decades since the first rockets flew, the only launch vehicle that was
capable of any kind of reuse was the Space Shuttle. For various reasons, the
Space Shuttle cost far more to fly than an equivalent non-reusable rocket; it
did its job well, but in the end, it was too expensive to refurbish and
rebuild the orbiter after every launch. In 2011, the Space Shuttle program
came to an end.

Reusable rockets aren't new. Although SpaceX was the [first company to
successfully recover the first stage of an orbital-class rocket in December of
2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_flight_20), reusable rockets have
been considered since the 1960s. Even the Saturn V, the rocket that launched
humans to the Moon, was the subject of [multiple proposals that would enable
partial recovery](http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum29/HTML/000880.html) of
the launch vehicle. In the end, none of these proposals were ever implemented.

In the 1990s, McDonnell Douglas began testing the
[DC-X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X), an experimental
testbed for building rockets capable of vertical landing and takeoff, or VTOL.
The DC-X vehicle [first flew in 1993](http://www.astronautix.com/d/dc-x.html),
and over the next three years it flew eleven more times. These were all small
hops of only one or two kilometers; the final flight reached an altitude of
only 2.5 kilometers. Even though it never demonstrated high-altitude flights,
it proved that building a VTOL rocket was possible.

The DC-X program was shelved when a [landing leg failed to deploy and the
rocket tipped over after landing, damaging the
aeroshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk-gGtC7xZ4). NASA did not have the
budget to devote to the DC-X program, and it was cancelled in 1996. Several of
the remaining DC-X engineers are [now
involved](https://www.airspacemag.com/space/black-day-at-white-sands-1381694/)
with [Blue Origin](/tags/blue-origin), which is working on its own reusable
rockets today.

Now, for an explanation of why it's so easy to reuse airplanes and
cars and why it's so difficult to reuse rockets.

Rockets that reach orbit need to fly very, very fast.
There is a huge difference between reaching _space_,
which is only
[100km above sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line);
and _orbit_, which requires a velocity of at least 7.6 kilometers per second.
That's 22 times the speed of sound. The only way to get that fast is to bring
a lot of fuel with you, and to bring fuel you need a place to store it.

At liftoff,
[modern
rockets are about 90% fuel by mass](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html). Of the remaining 10%
mass, the useful payload is usually less than 30% (or 3% of the total vehicle
mass at liftoff.) The lighter the rocket, the heavier the payload it can
launch into orbit. Everything you add to make a rocket reusable also reduces
the maximum payload.

This has made reusable rockets a difficult pill to swallow. The
payload capacity would need to be cut nearly in half to make even the
first stage reusable, and then you would need to prove that the stage
could reliably land and fly again with minimal maintenance. It's a
huge financial gamble that might not even work out.

In 2001, Elon Musk wanted to get the public excited in Mars, to push Congress
to increase funding for NASA. He decided to send a greenhouse to Mars, called
[Mars
Oasis](https://www.wired.com/2012/10/ff-elon-musk-qa/); in his words, it would "show great images of green
plants on a red background" and "get the public excited [about Mars.]" The
greenhouse itself would be relatively simple; but the rocket launch would not.
Musk visited Russia three times, attempting to buy used ICBMs; however, they
were far more expensive than he thought they would be. On the plane back to
the United States after his last trip to Russia, he turned to aerospace
consultant and friend Jim Cantrell and said, ["I think we can build a rocket
ourselves."](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a16681/elon-musk-interview-1212/)

>}}

In 2002, [Elon Musk founded SpaceX](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?SearchType=CORP&SearchCriteria=space+exploration+technologies&SearchSubType=Keyword) with the goal of making life
multiplanetary. As he saw it, the issue was that expendable rockets had a
fixed cost: because you needed to build a new rocket for each flight, you
couldn't distribute the manufacturing cost of the rocket across all of its
flights. Passenger jets cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but the cost is
spread out among all the flights. Reusable rockets were key to the dramatic
launch price reductions that would make space more accessible.

But before SpaceX could tackle reusability, they needed to build a rocket that
could reach orbit. Their first rocket, the Falcon 1, was a 21-meter tall
two-stage rocket. Its maiden launch, in 2006, [ended in failure after an
engine fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1#First_flight); the rocket
fell back into the ocean less than a minute after liftoff. The cause was
eventually traced to a nut that had corroded after exposure to saltwater
spray.

The next two launches did better, with Flight 3 nearly reaching orbit. At this
point, though, SpaceX was running low on money for a fourth flight, and Elon
had to personally fund the fourth launch of the Falcon 1.

At around the same time, SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell managed to
win SpaceX a NASA contract for the CRS program. Under this contract, SpaceX
was to be paid $1.6 billion for 12 resupply missions to the International
Space Station. The other winner of the contract, Orbital ATK, was a defense
supplier that had already [demonstrated dozens of successful orbital launches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Sciences_Corporation#Orbital_products). For
SpaceX to win this contract before they had even reached orbit demonstrated
the potential that NASA saw in the SpaceX engineers.

Thankfully, the fourth launch of the Falcon 1 went off without a hitch, as did
the fifth. At this point, SpaceX decided to begin the design process on their
new Dragon spacecraft and a new rocket: the Falcon 9. These were the vehicles
that SpaceX would fly to the ISS under the NASA resupply contract; and in the
future, SpaceX would modify the Dragon and Falcon 9 to fly crew.

Although the Falcon 1 never flew again, its legacy lives on in the Falcon 9.
Many of the key technologies in the Falcon 9 were proven in the Falcon 1,
including the Merlin engines and the tank construction. The Falcon 1 flights
even experimented with [recovering the first
stages with parachutes](https://www.wired.com/2008/09/space-x-did-it/), but the boosters kept breaking up
before the parachutes were even deployed. These lessons were very valuable
when SpaceX decided to design recovery systems for the Falcon 9.

***

>}}

The [Falcon 9 v1.0](/tags/spacex-falcon-9) is a two-stage rocket
standing 54 meters tall. It's large enough to launch cargo and crew to
the International Space Station with the
[Dragon capsule](/tags/spacex-dragon), and because it has nine
engines, it can still complete its mission even if an engine fails
during launch.

The Falcon 9 launched for the first time in 2010 and performed
flawlessly, deploying a dummy spacecraft into low-Earth orbit. Like on
the Falcon 1, SpaceX tried to put parachutes into the Falcon 9 first
stage; once again, the stages broke up before the parachutes even had
a chance to deploy.

So, in 2011, SpaceX announced that instead of using parachutes to
recover the first stage, they'd use actively-guided propulsive
landing. This means they'd use the Falcon 9's engines to guide the
booster back to land. This would involve
[several different maneuvers]({{< ref
"infographic/trajectory/spacex-falcon9-booster-rtls.md" >}}); first,
the booster would need to turn back towards land and restart three
engines for the **boostback burn**; then, it would turn to face
engines-first and restart the same three engines to slow it down in
the **entry burn**; finally, as it approached its landing pad, it
would start up the single center engine for the **landing burn**;
then, seconds before landing, it would deploy its four landing legs
and touch down on land only a few kilometers from its launchpad.

{{< img

>}}

However, such a plan would need a lot more fuel. Normally, the first stage
engines are shut down and the stages separated only when the fuel is nearly
depleted. SpaceX would need to shut the engines off earlier than normal and
leave a substantial amount of fuel onboard the first stage. This fuel would be
used to reignite the engines to fly the booster back to land. It would also
require very accurate control of the booster, or it would land dozens of
kilometers off-target, or worse, hit the ground at Mach 1 and explode.

So SpaceX built an experimental rocket, called the
[Grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_(rocket)). It made
eight successful flights in 2012 and 2013, demonstrating accurate throttle and
gimbal control of the engine. These flights were all small hops, similar to
those made by the DC-X. The Grasshopper vehicle demonstrated stable hovering,
horizontal diverts, and on its final flight, reached an altitude of over 700
meters. At this point, SpaceX had reached the limits of the Grasshopper, and
the vehicle was retired and replaced with the more capable F9R-Dev1.

{{< img

attrlink="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/17127808431/"
>}}

The [F9R-Dev1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_(rocket)#F9R_Dev1_flight_tests) was a more advanced version of the Grasshopper; where the
Grasshopper featured custom landing legs and other hardware, the F9R-Dev1 was
a mostly standard Falcon 9 v1.1 booster. Even the landing legs were the
prototype carbon-fiber legs that would eventually be used on the Falcon 9. The
F9R-Dev1 flew five times, reaching a peak altitude of one kilometer; on its
final flight, a blocked sensor caused the vehicle to veer off course, and the
flight termination system was triggered, ending the flight.

In 2013, SpaceX flew the [first flight of a significantly larger Falcon 9
v1.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_v1.1), with almost twice the fuel
capacity, along with internal modifications that would allow legs and other
hardware to be attached. Over the next few flights of the upgraded Falcon 9,
SpaceX attempted to perform soft ocean landings to demonstrate the technology;
the first successful landing was with the CRS-3 mission. The booster touched
down on the ocean's surface during a storm, and although it splashed down
gently, it broke apart when it hit the ocean, as expected.

Next, SpaceX needed a place to land. They hadn't yet built a landing
pad, and they also hadn't received permission to bring a rocket back
to land. Ocean landings wouldn't work; the booster was so tall that it
would disintegrate when it fell into the ocean. So they modified a
barge, converting it to a powered droneship, and painted a giant "X"
on it. It was sent out into the ocean for the first time in 2015, for
the CRS-5 mission.

>}}

The CRS-5 launch went perfectly, and the Falcon 9 booster performed all the
necessary engine burns flawlessly; however, the grid fins used for maneuvering
the booster ran out of hydraulic fluid, and the booster smashed into the
droneship at highway speeds. Needless to say, the landing was [not very
smooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3nMsUvakPM), and the only parts that
came back were in a pile on the droneship, covered by a tarp.

The next attempt, with the CRS-6 mission, did far better. The booster
performed perfectly, but when it was less than ten seconds from landing, an
engine throttle valve got stuck, and the booster landed hard and tipped over
seconds later. Just like CRS-5, they brought back the [remains of the booster
in a
pile](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/32x6e8/rjacksonville_delivers_hd_image_of_asdsjrti/).

On the next launch, with the CRS-7 mission, the launch vehicle failed before
there was a chance to attempt a landing, and the CRS-7 Dragon capsule was
destroyed. SpaceX was grounded for several months while they solved the issues
that caused the CRS-7 failure.

***

In the meantime, Blue Origin's experimental test program, shrouded in secrecy
for years, announced that their New Shepard rocket had become the [first ever
rocket to reach space and land
vertically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pillaOxGCo). The New Shepard
booster, like the Falcon 9, was designed to be reusable; unlike SpaceX, Blue
Origin had been planning to land their rockets propulsively from the start,
and they had been quietly experimenting with it for over a decade.

The New Shepard vehicle is about 15 meters tall and has many different
types of fins to stabilize and control the vehicle as it returns to
Earth; notably, at the bottom of the vehicle, there are four
maneuvering fins; and at the top of the vehicle, there are drag brakes
(to slow the vehicle) and wedge fins (to keep the vehicle
stable) mounted to the ring fin.

Whereas the Falcon 9's purpose is to launch payloads into orbit, the
New Shepard is both a testbed and a space tourism platform. It's
capable of launching multiple space tourists to 100km and returning
them safely, requiring far less energy than reaching orbit. For this
reason, the New Shepard is fully reusable; both the crew capsule and
the propulsion module can be recovered and reused for future flights.

SpaceX's next mission was the Orbcomm OG2-M2 launch; the first flight
after the CRS-7 inflight breakup. It was also the first Falcon 9 to be
powered by densified propellant; this, combined with the lightweight
payload, meant that the Falcon 9 booster could return to the launch
site.

The flight was picture-perfect, and less than ten minutes after
liftoff, the booster touched down smoothly and softly at SpaceX's
landing pad at Cape Canaveral, marking the world's first recovery of
an orbital-class booster.

On March 30, 2017, SpaceX made history when they launched a rocket with a
reused booster for the [SES-10 mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES-10),
cementing SpaceX's place in history as the first company to ever refly a
recovered booster from an orbital-class launch vehicle. This marked a major
milestone in the journey for reusable rockets.

Over the next few months, SpaceX continued to recover every core they could,
and so far, they've recovered 25 more boosters, by land and by sea. Two of
these cores were converted into Falcon Heavy [side
boosters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy_test_flight#Rocket_configuration).
Alongside a brand-new center core, they launched the Falcon Heavy into space,
along with its test payload: Elon's [original Tesla
Roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk%27s_Tesla_Roadster). The
side boosters both flew back and landed at Cape Canaveral, only about 500
meters and 3 seconds apart.

While it's not economically sensible to recover and reuse the Falcon 9 upper
stage, SpaceX is working hard at recovering the Falcon 9 fairings. Combined,
they cost [about $6
million](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/spacex-misses-catching-falcon-9-rocket-fairing-with-a-giant-net-on-a-big-ship/)
(about 10% of the total cost of the rocket), and they take up a substantial
amount of floor space in the factory to build.

In September of 2016, SpaceX announced their [Interplanetary Transportation
System](/tags/spacex-its), a rocket SpaceX hopes will begin the colonization
of Mars. Both the first and second stages will be recovered and reused on
every launch, dramatically reducing launch prices and opening up whole new
worlds of human space exploration. SpaceX plans to reuse the booster a
staggering 1,000 times; the propellant tanker and Mars lander are planned to
be reused 100 and 12 times, respectively. These numbers bring Mars colonization
within reach for the first time ever.

***

The final flight of the Blue Origin NS2 vehicle was in 2016, with the crew
capsule [performing an in-flight
abort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESc_0MgmqOA) to verify the safety of
the crew in the case of a booster failure. Miraculously, the booster survived
the heat and debris from the solid rocket motor exhaust, then proceeded to
continue its flight to space. Only a few minutes later, it performed a smooth
landing on its landing pad. The booster was retired, and Blue Origin plans to
perform more test flights this year. They're planning to fly crew by the end
of 2018.

Recently, Blue Origin unveiled their proposed orbital launch vehicle, the [New
Glenn](https://www.blueorigin.com/new-glenn). Like the Falcon 9, the first
stage is built to be reusable; it will land itself on a ship in the ocean
under its own engine power. Blue Origin is currently building a factory for
the New Glenn at Cape Canaveral, and they hope to perform the first flights of
the new vehicle by 2020.

With Blue Origin and SpaceX both demonstrating that booster reuse is possible,
it now falls to the rest of the industry to follow along. Soon, the price for
a launch on a reused rocket will drop, and the entire launch industry will
need to lower their prices to remain competitive. I, for one, cannot wait for
the low-cost future of spaceflight, where launches don't cost tens or hundreds
of millions of dollars; where you don't need to be a giant international
corporation to launch your satellites.

And just maybe, a future where your address will need to specify a planet.
