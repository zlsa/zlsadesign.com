I'm Jon Ross, and I make
[infographics](/infographic/),
[renders of rockets](/img/post/spacex/fh-launch.jpg) and
[spacecraft](/img/post/spacex/red-dragon-landing.jpg), and
[software](http://github.com/zlsa/).

# 3D Art

For my 3D renders, I use [Blender](http://blender.org/) for the entire
3D pipeline; [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is used for sketching 2D
textures. I don't actually use Inkscape that often; I tend to model
and then bake my textures directly in a separate Blender model. This
lets me use Blender's tools (such as dupliverts and arrays) and, as a
bonus, produces high-quality normal maps.

# Programming

My strengths are in JS

This blog will probably consist
of mostly technical material, interspersed with infographics and/or
renders.
