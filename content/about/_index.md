# Frequently Asked Questions

## How I make 3D Art

For my 3D art, I use [Blender](http://blender.org/) for the entire 3D
pipeline, from modeling to unwrapping, texturing, and animating;
[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is used for sketching 2D textures. I
don't actually use Inkscape that often; I tend to model and then bake
my textures directly in a separate Blender model. This lets me use
Blender's tools (such as dupliverts and arrays) and, as a bonus,
produces high-quality normal maps.

# Corrections and suggestions

Have you found a mistake in an infographic or article? I welcome
corrections and suggestions on anything. No matter what, you can email
me at [jonross.zlsa@gmail.com](mailto:jonross.zlsa@gmail.com);
however, for my projects on GitHub, it will be faster if you open a
new issue on that project instead of emailing me. I'll fix the
mistakes as fast as I can.

# Donating

If you like what I do (whether it's my [apps](/app/), my
[infographics](/infographic/), or anything else I've made) and you
want to show your appreciation, [donations](/donate/) are a great way to show
it!
