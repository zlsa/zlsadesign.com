# Frequently Asked Questions

## How I make 3D Art

For my 3D art, I use [Blender](http://blender.org/) for the entire 3D
pipeline, from modeling to unwrapping, texturing, and animating;
[Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) is used for sketching 2D textures. I
don't actually use Inkscape that often; I tend to model and then bake
my textures directly in a separate Blender model. This lets me use
Blender's tools (such as dupliverts and arrays) and, as a bonus,
produces high-quality normal maps.

# Donations

At best, ads consume bandwidth and take up space; at worst, they're
unskippable or phishing attempts. I wouldn't view a website or use an
app that has annoying ads, so in reciprocation, everything I make is
100% ad-free.

If you like what I do (whether it's my [apps](/app/), my
[infographics](/infographic/), or anything else I've made) and you
want to show your appreciation, donating to me is a great way to show
it!
