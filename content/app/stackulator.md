Stackulator is a minimal postfix calculator for Android.

With its beautiful design and streamlined interface, you'll soon fall
in love with math again. (Provided your math is simple, of course. You
can't expect a calculator to do complex math, can you?)

# Postfix (RPN) Calculator

Unlike "infix" calculators, Stackulator is a postfix calculator. This
simplifies input and streamlines calculations, helping you math faster
better than ever before.

# Material Design

Modeled after Android Nougat's calculator, Stackulator's design is
clean and minimal. Your math has never looked *quite* so pretty.

*Currently an alpha product, Stackulator will be improved with your feedback. Thank you for your help.*
