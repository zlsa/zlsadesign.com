This infographic demonstrates the three methods of control used by the
[SpaceX Falcon 9](/tags/spacex-falcon9/) during its flight.

# Thrust vectoring

Also used during ascent, thrust vectoring refers to the ability to
"vector" the engines' thrust, also known as gimbal. This is an
extremely effective method of control, but it requires the engines to
produce thrust.

# Grid fins

Grid fins produce aerodynamic force, which means their effectiveness
is related to the airspeed of the vehicle. When using grid fins, the
Falcon 9 is "gliding" down; the grid fins tilt the booster,
effectively aiming the Falcon 9 like an oversized dart.

# Nitrogen [RCS]({{< ref "term/rcs.md" >}})

The cold gas thrusters at the top of the vehicle can rotate the stage;
however, they're quite weak compared to thrust vectoring and grid
fins. However, since they work even in the vacuum of space, they're
used to flip the booster after stage separation and for attitude
control prior to atmospheric entry (at which point the grid fins take
over.)
