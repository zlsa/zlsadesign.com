This is an overview of the operations the [SpaceX ITS](/tags/spacex-its/) will take when it
departs from Earth for its [#JourneyToMars](/tags/mars/).

1. Passengers launch aboard the Mars spacecraft.
2. Once the Mars spacecraft is in orbit, multiple tankers are sent
   into orbit to refuel the Mars-bound spacecraft. (Elon said they
   would refuel Mars-bound spacecraft with three to five propellant
   tankers, depending on travel time and spacecraft cargo.) These
   propellant tankers launch on the same reusable booster as the Mars
   spacecraft, and the tankers themselves will land at the launch site
   for rapid reuse.
3. As soon as all the necessary propellant has been transferred, the
   Mars spacecraft will perform its [TMI burn](/term/tmi).
4. The Mars spacecraft (and its passengers or cargo) spend the next
   few months in interplanetary space.
