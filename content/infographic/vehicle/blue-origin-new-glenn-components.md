This is a brief overview of the components of the
[Blue Origin New Glenn](/tags/blue-origin-new-glenn/) in its two-stage configuration.

# Overview

The New Glenn is a two or three-stage orbital launch vehicle,
developed by [Blue Origin](/tags/blue-origin/). The first stage burns
methalox with seven [BE-4](/tags/blue-origin-be4) engines; the second
stage, also methalox, is powered by the
[BE-4U](/term/blue-origin-be4u).

An optional hydrolox third stage, used for high-energy destinations
such as GTO/GEO, would be powered by a [BE-3U](/tags/blue-origin-be3u)
engine; the non-vacuum variant, the [BE-3](/tags/blue-origin-be3),
powers Blue Origin's [New Shepard](/tags/blue-origin-new-shepard)
vehicle.
