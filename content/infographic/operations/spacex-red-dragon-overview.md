This is an overview of the operations an unmanned
[SpaceX Red Dragon](/tags/spacex-red-dragon/) capsule will take on its
mission to Mars.

<!--more-->

1. A Red Dragon capsule, a modified and stripped-down
   [Crew Dragon](/tags/spacex-crew-dragon) capsule, is launched atop a
   [SpaceX Falcon Heavy](/tags/spacex-falcon-heavy) launch vehicle.
2. After the Red Dragon capsule has been injected into a parking
   orbit, the second stage of the Falcon Heavy shuts down.
3. The second stage of the Falcon Heavy reignites for the
   [TMI burn](/term/tmi) to send Red Dragon on a Mars-bound
   trajectory. Somewhere around here, Red Dragon's nosecone is
   jettisoned to reduce the total mass of the spacecraft.
4. After the TMI burn is complete, Red Dragon separates itself from
   the second stage of the Falcon Heavy.
5. During the several-month interplanetary coast period, Red Dragon
   will spin on its axis, like a huge top. This is called a "barbecue
   roll", and it's done to even out the temperature differential that
   occurs when only one side of the spacecraft faces the sun at all
   times. (Read more about
   [Orion's barbecue roll](https://blogs.nasa.gov/orion/2014/12/05/orion-in-barbecue-roll-during-coast-phase/)).
6. As Red Dragon approaches Mars, it decouples its trunk. The trunk
   will burn up upon atmospheric entry.
7. Red Dragon orients itself heatshield-end first in preparation for
   atmospheric entry.
8. After atmospheric entry, Red Dragon's onboard computers calculate
   the landing burn. Because of Red Dragon's limited fuel capacity, it
   must perform a [hoverslam](/term/hoverslam).
9. Touchdown on Mars.

# FAQ

## Will Red Dragon carry astronauts to Mars?

No. Red Dragon's maximum capacity is seven astronauts, and it can only
support those astronauts for a very short time in
[LEO](/terms/leo). Red Dragon is a stripped-down version of SpaceX's
Crew Dragon, and it cannot support passengers. Even if it could carry
astronauts to the surface of Mars, it would expend all of its limited
fuel in doing so, and the astronauts would have no way to return to
Earth.

## Why are there no fins on Red Dragon's trunk?

Because the fins are only needed in a launch abort. Since Red Dragon
is an unmanned capsule, launch abort isn't strictly necessary;
besides, unlike most missions, the Red Dragon is very
mass-limited. There's no reason to install fins on a vehicle whose
mission will fail anyway during an abort.
