This is the approximate trajectory of the [SpaceX
ITS](/tags/spacex-its) Mars lander during its approach, entry,
descent, and landing phases. SpaceX has not released the Earth reentry
trajectory, but it will probably be similar, albeit with lower speeds
and a far denser atmosphere (which translates to a far shorter and
more vertical glide.)
