This is the approximate trajectory of the [Blue Origin New Glenn
booster](/tags/blue-origin-new-glenn-booster/) during a launch.

The New Glenn booster will be recovered on every mission.

# Glide

The two "wings" on the lower half of the booster are for aerodynamic
lift; however, their purpose hasn't been officially given (besides
Bezos's statements that it helps reduce entry stresses.) It's a good
guess that they'll be used (in conjunction with the four maneuvering
fins mounted to the interstage) to perform wide S-turns in the upper
atmosphere, to help bleed off speed without severely impacting
downrange distance (which would require the recovery vessel to travel
far further than necessary.)

# Landing

The booster lands atop the deck of a moving ship. It's been confirmed
that the ship will in fact be moving at the time of landing, and that
it's not just an artistic liberty taken by the animators. Bezos said
that the moving ship increases stability; in addition, the simple
linear motion of the ship isn't very hard to account for.

I personally expect New Glenn to nail the landings on the moving ship.
