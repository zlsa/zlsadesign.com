This is the approximate trajectory of the
[SpaceX Falcon 9](/tags/spacex-falcon9) booster during a downrange
propulsive landing (i.e. ocean landing) on the
[ASDS](/tags/spacex-asds).

Note that this is the trajectory of a booster during a
high-performance mission, and does not include a
[boostback burn]({{< ref "term/boostback-burn.md" >}}). The approximate trajectory of a
Falcon 9 landing with a boostback burn [can be seen here]({{< ref
"infographic/trajectory/spacex-falcon9-booster-dpl.md" >}}).

1. The Falcon 9 launches, as normal.
2. After stage separation, the second stage engine ignites to continue
   its trip into orbit. The booster stage flips around using its
   [RCS thrusters]({{< ref "term/rcs.md" >}}) and deploys its [grid fins]({{< ref "term/grid-fins.md" >}}).
3. The Falcon 9 coasts through its apogee on a ballistic trajectory.
4. At about 70km in altitude, the booster ignites three of its nine
   engines for its [entry burn]({{< ref "term/entry-burn.md" >}}). The
   entry burn ends at about 40km. The entry burn slows down the
   booster to prevent aerodynamic damage as it begins to pass through
   the atmosphere.
5. The grid fins constantly control the trajectory of the booster,
   directing it towards the ASDS.
6. At about 8km in altitude, the landing burn begins. On most
   missions, this is done with only the center engine; however, on
   some high-performance missions, three engines are used
   instead. Three-engine landing burns use less fuel but are also more
   risky; however, they allow the booster to provide more velocity to
   the payload than a single-engine landing burn.
7. Seconds before touchdown, the four landing legs deploy.
8. The booster touches down on the ASDS; the RCS thrusters at the top
   of the booster help stabilize the vehicle. Soon afterwards, unused
   [LOx]({{< ref "term/propellant/lox.md" >}}) is vented; the [RP-1 (kerosene)]({{< ref
   "term/propellant/rp-1.md" >}}) propellant remains in the tank.
