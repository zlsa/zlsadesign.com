This is the approximate trajectory of the
[SpaceX Red Dragon](/tags/spacex-red-dragon/) capsule during its
landing on Mars.

<!--more-->

1. Red Dragon controls its trajectory by sliding a mass along an
   internal rail (to shift the center of mass) and rolling along its
   long axis. This is used to fine-tune the landing ellipse.
2. After the period of peak heating, Red Dragon continues to adjust
   its trajectory. During this time, it's still travelling at several
   times the speed of sound; the vehicle bleeds off speed while
   gaining some altitude.
3. As Red Dragon approaches the surface, its eight SuperDraco engines
   ignite for the landing. At this point, Red Dragon is travelling at
   its terminal velocity of about Mach 2.
4. The four landing feet, built into the bottom of Red Dragon (and
   integrated into the heatshield) extend moments before touchdown.
5. Red Dragon touches down on Mars.
