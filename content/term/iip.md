The "Instantaneous Impact Point", or *IIP*, is the location at which
the vehicle would contact the ground if all thrust were to be
instantly terminated. During a launch, the IIP must remain within a
narrow "corridor"; if the IIP leaves the corridor, the vehicle's
trajectory is very wrong and the [flight termination system]({{<
ref "term/fts.md" >}}) is immediately activated.
