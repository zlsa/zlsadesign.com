The "Entry Burn" is the maneuver that [SpaceX](/tags/spacex) uses on
the [Falcon 9](/tags/spacex-falcon9)
[booster](/tags/spacex-falcon9-stage-one) immediately before
atmospheric entry. It's used to slow down the booster before it
encounters the atmosphere; it's typically used from about 70km down to
40km. If the reentry burn is skipped or shortened, the booster will
break apart at about 40km due to the exponential increase in
atmospheric pressure.
