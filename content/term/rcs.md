The "Reaction Control System", or *RCS*, comprises of thrusters
mounted on the vehicle that fire to adjust the vehicle's orientation
and trajectory. RCS is one of the few control methods that works in
the vacuum of space; it's used on crew capsules, resupply vehicles,
upper stages, and even on the
[Falcon 9 booster](/tags/spacex-falcon9-booster) (allowing it to flip
itself around in the upper atmosphere.)
