The "Boostback Burn" is the maneuver that [SpaceX](/tags/spacex) uses
on the [Falcon 9](/tags/spacex-falcon9)
[booster](/tags/spacex-falcon9-stage-one) as well as the
[ITS](/tags/spacex-its) [booster](/tags/spacex-its-stage-one). It is a
retrograde burn, performed immediately after stage separation, that
redirects the [IIP](/term/iip) to the landing pad.
