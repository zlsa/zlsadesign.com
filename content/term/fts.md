The "Flight Termination System", or *FTS*, describes the part of the
vehicle that ensures its destruction in the case of an out-of-control
or failing vehicle. For most launch vehicles employing cryogenic
propellants, triggering the FTS "unzips" the propellant tanks along
their length, releasing the propellants in a semi-controlled manner.
