So, this is my new website. It's taken a while to get it online; I've
wanted to place my disparate, one-off websites under one
(good-looking) roof for years, and it's finally coming together.

# Technical details

This website is statically generated with
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). It's using a custom theme, built from
scratch _(with <3)_ to conform to my own standards. No, it's not a
Material Design blog with ripples and floating action buttons
everywhere; nor is it a "minimal" website featuring only two colors:
black and white.

This website is fully responsive, and it will look great on all
devices, regardless of size. All the information is present on all
display sizes; none of this "eh, nobody _really_ wants to see
<whatever> on a phone" business.
