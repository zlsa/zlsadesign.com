I've been informed that all of the "cool kids" nowadays have blogs (or
blags), and I want to get in on it. At the same time, I want to avoid
uttering the dreaded words "Welcome to my blog!" because that is
basically a guarantee that your blog will never, ever be updated. (Or
looked at.)

Anyway, I suppose the first post in a blog is generally the
introduction. I'm Jon Ross, and I make
[infographics](http://zlsa.github.io/infographics/),
[renders of rockets](/img/post/spacex/fh-launch.jpg) and
[spacecraft](/img/post/spacex/red-dragon-landing.jpg), and
[software](http://github.com/zlsa/). This blog will probably consist
of mostly technical material, interspersed with infographics and/or
renders.
