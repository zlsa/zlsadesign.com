My rendition of the [Red Dragon](/tags/spacex-red-dragon) capsule as
it deploys its trunk in preparation for atmospheric entry, just
minutes away.

Launching on a [Falcon Heavy](/tags/spacex-falcon-heavy) from LC-39A
at Cape Canaveral no earlier than 2020, the Red Dragon missions will
demonstrate powered landings on the Red Planet.
