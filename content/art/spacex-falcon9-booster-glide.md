My rendition of a [Falcon 9 booster](/tags/spacex-falcon9-stage-one)
returning to Earth after a launch. The four grid fins are guiding it
towards its landing pad as it hurtles downwards at supersonic
velocities.

In this image, the Falcon 9 is at about 40km in altitude (with entry
burn shutdown having occured seconds earlier) and is less than thirty
seconds from the start of the landing burn.
