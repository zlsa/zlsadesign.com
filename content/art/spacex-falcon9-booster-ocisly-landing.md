My rendition of a [Falcon 9 booster](/tags/spacex-falcon9-stage-one)
landing on Of Course I Still Love You, SpaceX's East coast
[droneship](/tags/spacex-asds). This is a triple-engine landing burn;
while SpaceX hasn't performed a triple-engine landing burn since
JCSAT-16, very heavy GTO payloads at the edge of Falcon 9's capability
may require triple-engine landing burns in the future.

In this image, the two outer engines have begun to shut down, allowing
the single center engine to precisely control the vehicle during the
final stages of landing on the droneship. Before landing, water was
sprayed onto the steel deck; the engine exhaust instantly vaporizes it
into steam and blows it off the deck.
